**Introdução React Native:** [Introdução](https://docs.rocketseat.dev/ambiente-react-native/introducao)


## Quick Overview

Make sure you have Node v6 or later installed. No Xcode or Android Studio installation is required.
```
npm install -g expo-cli 
expo init my-app
cd my-app/ 
npm start 
```

The  `npm start`  command starts the Expo CLI server. You can now run the project on your phone by using the Expo app.

### [](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#android)Android

-   Install the  [Expo](https://expo.io/)  app on your Android device.
-   Scan the QR code in your terminal from the Expo app to run the project on your phone.
-   Alternatively you can press 's' in the terminal and sign in with an Expo account, and sign in with the same account in the Expo app: your projects will automatically appear in the "Projects" tab.

### [](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#ios)iOS

-   Install the  [Expo](https://expo.io/)  app on your iOS device.
-   Press 'e' in the terminal to send the app link to your email address or phone number. This link can be used to run your project from the Expo app.
-   Alternatively you can press 's' in the terminal and sign in with an Expo account, and sign in with the same account in the Expo app: your projects will automatically appear in the "Projects" tab.

Expo CLI allows you to work with all of the  [Components and APIs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)  in React Native, as well as the  [JavaScript APIs](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/sdk/index.html)  that the Expo app provides.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>

Open [http://localhost:19002](http://localhost:19002) To view the project in the browser you will need to initialize an option using expo by pressing the 'w' key after the project is started.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`


Runs the  [jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest)  test runner on your tests.

#### [](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#npm-run-ios)`npm run ios`

Like  `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app in the iOS Simulator if you're on a Mac and have it installed.

#### [](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#npm-run-android)`npm run android`

Like  `npm start`, but also attempts to open your app on a connected Android device or emulator. Requires an installation of Android build tools (see  [React Native docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html)  for detailed setup).

#### [](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app#npm-run-eject)`npm run eject`

**Warning:** Running eject is a **permanent** action. Please use a version control system, such as git, so you can revert back if necessary. An ejected app will require you to have an [Xcode and/or Android Studio environment](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) set up.
